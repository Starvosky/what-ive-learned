  <p>I learned how to make an effective wireframe that helps me build with HTML and CSS. Before I'd just build my HTML as I went along without a set idea of what I'd like it to look like. Now as I build my resume I've created a sort of foundation on the idea of wireframes and how to effectively deploy it's use. I'm not going to say I've made the most effective use of this particular skill just yet but I'm willing to bet I'll get a lot better as time goes on.
